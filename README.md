# Application Setup
To run the application locally, first create and enter a virtual environment. 
Next, install necessary dependencies from the cs50 library with the following command.
      pip install cs50

While in the virtual environment and with dependencies installed, ensure you are in the project directory.
Run 'flask run' in the terminal. Clicking the subsequenturl will then direct you to a local version of Crimson Connect. 

# Using the App
To access the features of the website, create an account by clicking the designated hyperlink 'Create an account'. Afterwards, log in with your username and password on the welcome page.

Upon logging in, you will be asked to fill out a detailed form with your background information and interests. Please make sure that fields are completed as specified. After creating a profile, you will be directed to the homepage. Clicking the profile icon in the navigation bar will direct you to the profile page, which displays all the information that you have provided in the profile creation form. By clicking 'Settings' in the navigation bar's dropdown menu, you will also be able to upload a profile picture as well as provide a brief bio that will also be displayed on your profile page.

On the homepage, there is a button labeled 'Match Me!', which upon clicking, will lead you to a page that displays a list of other users who have the most in common with you. In the row for each user, clicking 'View Profile' will direct you to their profile page and 'Save' will save the user to a list, which you can access by clicking the multi-person icon in the navigation bar. This list contains all the users whom you have saved from the matching feature, allowing you to visit their profile later on or unsave them from this list. These are all the current available features of CrimsonConnect, which I hope you will test out.
